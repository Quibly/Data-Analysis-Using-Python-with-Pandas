# Overview

As a Software Developer major I am working to expand my understanding of Data Analysis.
This program was written to practice using Pandas with Python to analyze data.

I will be using a dataset sourced from kaggle.com. The dataset titled 'Student Alcohol Consumption'
includes details about alcohol consumption associated with other demographic details about student
age, sex, family information, education levels of parents, and more.

The purpose of my program is to use the dataset to look for correlations between alcohol consumption
and lower grades, free time and going out times. And I will be including additional details comparing
alcohol consumption to family size.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle.com as a .CSV file. The file needed to be converted to
a Pandas object for use within Python. Then, using various data filters, sorts, aggrations,
and conversions, I was able to format my data to be presented visual through graphs and charts.

I used the Pandas module with Python to analyze the dataset and display the results.
