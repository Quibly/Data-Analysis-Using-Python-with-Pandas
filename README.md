# Overview

As a Software Developer major I am working to expand my understanding of Data Analysis.

This program was written to practice using Pandas with Python to analyze data.

I will be using a dataset sourced from kaggle.com. The dataset titled 'Student Alcohol Consumption' includes details about alcohol consumption associated with other demographic details about student age, sex, family information, education levels of parents, and more.

The purpose of my program is to use the dataset to look for correlations between alcohol consumption and lower grades, free time and going out times, and family size.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

* Question 1: What does a comparison of alcohol consumption to grades look like? Answer: There seems to be a slight trend. Grades came down a bit the more alcohol was consumed.
* Question 2: What does a comparison of alcohol consumption to free time look like? Answer: There seems to be a substantial trend. Alcohol consumptino went way up as more free time was available.
* Question 3: What does a comparison of alcohol consumption to family size look like? Answer: There is a slight difference. The average didn't change much.

# Development Environment

I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle.com as a .CSV file. The file needed to be converted to a Pandas object for use within Python. Then, using various data filters, sorts, aggrations, and conversions, I was able to format my data to be presented visual through graphs and charts.

I used the Pandas and Matplotlib modules with Python3 to analyze the dataset and display the results.

# Future Work

* I want to improve the layout and colors of some of the charts.
* I need figure out how to change the tick labels on the charts.
* Incorporating the outputs into an organized web display would be fun.
